# U-NET-for-medical-image-segmentation
U-Net neural network architecture developed based on Ronneberger, Fischer and Bronx's work (2015) as a part of Computer Vision coursework at Imperial College London, taught by @baiwenjia. 

**Requirements** \n
In order to run this code, you will need Jupyter-lab (https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and other libraries used. To install those, run the command as follows:

_`pip3 install [package_name]`_

**GPU resource** \n
Due to pre-processing performed on images, this code will run on CPU.

However, to save training time, you may want to use GPU. In that case, you can run this notebook on Google Colab. On Google Colab, go to the menu, Runtime - Change runtime type, and select **GPU** as the hardware acceleartor.
